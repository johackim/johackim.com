It’snot something to be afraid of, to worry about or to avoid.</p><p><strong>Vertical coherence</strong> - we&#x27;re going to be like the geneticists who have this vertical coherence in their work andthroughout their lives.</p><p><strong>Fixing time, flexing scope</strong> - learning how to set deadlines that again manage our psychological biases andinternal clocks.</p><h2>Module 1: Your 25-Year Vision and Quarterly Plan</h2><h3>1.0 - Introduction: Why Career Planning is Career Limiting</h3><p>The purpose of the <em>Long-Range and Quarterly Planning Module</em> is to help you work towards what we refer to as <strong>Product / Market / Founder Fit.</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/N9BAE3u.png\" alt=\"\"/></p><p>This means finding the overlap between what you are good at (<em>founder</em>), what you like to do on a day-to-day basis (<em>market</em>), and what the market wants (<em>product</em>).</p><p>After 90 days, you are free to change your mind or your direction. Ninety Days is right at the intersection of overestimating and underestimating. We often overestimate how much we can get done in a day, but underestimate how much we can get done in a year.</p><h3>1.1 - Creating Your 25-Year Vision: Getting Clarity</h3><p><strong>Aspirational Vision Template</strong></p><p>“If you were reading this twenty five years from today, and reflecting on the events of those twenty five years, what has to have happened in your [INSERT AREA] life for you to feel successful?”</p><p>Remember: This is goal setting.
